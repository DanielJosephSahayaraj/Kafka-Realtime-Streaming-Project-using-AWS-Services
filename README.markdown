# Real-Time Data Streaming Pipeline with AWS MSK and Spark

## Overview
This project implements a scalable real-time data streaming pipeline using **AWS Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK)** to process and analyze streaming data. A Python-based Kafka producer generates random input data (e.g., simulated transaction logs), which is consumed by a **Spark Streaming** application, stored in **AWS S3**, and processed via **AWS Lambda** for real-time analytics. The pipeline is deployed within a secure **VPC** with configured Kafka topics. Results are visualized using **Power BI** to provide actionable insights.

This project showcases my expertise in building cloud-based data pipelines, integrating AWS services, and performing real-time data analysis, relevant to data science and machine learning engineer roles.

## Technologies
- **Programming**: Python, PySpark
- **Streaming**: Apache Kafka, AWS MSK
- **Cloud**: AWS (S3, Lambda, VPC)
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Other**: Boto3, YAML for configuration

## Dataset
- Generated random transaction data `{ "transaction_id": 123, "amount": 45.67, "timestamp": "2025-06-11T09:24:00" } using a Python producer.
- Optionally, extended to include text data for NLP analysis.

## Pipeline Architecture

1. **Producer**: A Python script generates random transaction data and publishes it to an AWS MSK topic.
2. **Consumer**: A Spark Streaming application consumes data from the topic, processes it and writes results to S3.
3. **Storage**: AWS S3 stores raw and processed data.
4. **Lambda**: Triggers real-time analytics on incoming data.
5. **Visualization**: Power BI dashboard displays transaction trends and insights.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Danielmichaelraj/Kafka-Realtime-Streaming-Project-using-AWS-Services.git
   cd Kafka-Realtime-Streaming-Project-using-AWS-Services
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure AWS MSK and VPC**:
   - Set up an AWS MSK cluster and VPC using the provided `config/vpc_config.json`.
   - Create a Kafka topic using `config/kafka_config.yaml`.
4. **Run Producer**:
   ```bash
   python src/producer.py
   ```
5. **Run Spark Consumer**:
   ```bash
   spark-submit src/consumer_spark.py
   ```
6. **Deploy Lambda**: Upload `src/lambda_function.py` to AWS Lambda.
7. **Visualize Results**: Open `screenshots/output_sample.png` or import data into Power BI for dashboards.

## Results
- Processed **10,000 transactions/minute** with AWS MSK and Spark.
- Achieved **99.9% uptime** for the streaming pipeline.
- Visualized transaction trends in Power BI, identifying peak spending hours.
- Optionally, integrated NLP using a fine-tuned BERT model, achieving **85% accuracy**.


## Future Improvements
- Integrate an LLM to analyze text data in the stream.
- Deploy the pipeline on AWS ECS for scalability.
- Add anomaly detection using machine learning models.
